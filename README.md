# notability-zotero-sync
Zotero is a great PDF storage software. For books I generally download from zotero to my ipad to read and annotate. However once annotated I have two different copies of the PDF and would like to read my annotatoins from my computer through zotero. 

Notability stores in .note format, need to convert to pdf. This repo could be useful:
https://github.com/dvdblk/notability-notes-converter/blob/master/notability_pdf_export.scpt
Uses a .scpt file Apple Script Editor of mac ?

Pain points:
- notability stores in google drive in .note format which can only be exported to pdf
through notability client
- notability client no longer is "scriptable" in the AppleScript sense of the word.
This means using the application to automatically do this is painful
